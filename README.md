The dataset that I used is from the DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Challenge, and includes images for multi-class segmentation, targeting various land cover types such as urban areas, agricultural zones, rangelands, forests, water bodies, barren regions, and unknown areas. This data supports the automatic classification of these diverse land cover categories.
The dataset used in this challenge is comprehensive, but the original file size was too large to be processed on my computer, and the photos which are linked to the csv file were not able to upload. Consequently, I had to condense the dataset to fit within manageable limits. As a result, the file size and potentially some data specifics may differ from the original dataset. This modification was necessary given the technology that is available to me. Please note that this may affect the file size reading and other related metrics.
